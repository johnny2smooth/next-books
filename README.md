# Just a simple way to get a book recommendation

I wanted to use Notion as a simple DB to store book recommendations while I tried out Next 13. I used simple fetch requests and Notion's JavaScript SDK to achieve this. I also used Tailwind to style the page.

**Send me a rec:** [link]("https://book-recommendations.vercel.app/")

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Notion, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Vercel

I used Notion's JavaScript SDK to fetch the data from my Notion database. I used Next.js to create the API routes that I needed to fetch the data. I used Tailwind to style the page. I used Vercel to deploy the app. I used TypeScript to type the data that I was fetching from Notion. I used JavaScript to fetch the data from Notion.
